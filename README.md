# AMGLib-Plus

An advanced 3D Graphics Engine for PSPSDK coders, users and developers. It provides, in an easy way, to create 3D meshes, such as loading 3D models, lighting, textures, cel-shading, a physics engine, 2D sprites and text fonts, and much more...

It's a remake of an older library (AMGLib), but while recompiling and fixing its bugs, it happened that the syntax has changed a lot. The language has been changed to C++, to give better compatability and performance.
